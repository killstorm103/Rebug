- Anything not listed is untested and not guaranteed to work!
- Just because it's not listed doesn't mean it doesn't work before asking me if i'm gonna add support for a SoftWare or version of Minecraft go check and make sure Rebug doesn't work on it!


- it's my first plugin!, i'm still new to server plugin development
- Rebug is made for my Minecraft server to test things like AntiCheats and Exploits
- it's the first of it's kind as no other Test Server/AntiCheat Switcher plugin is public or open src(that i know of)!

- Rebug comes ready to go all you have to do is: download and install the AntiCheats you want to be able to test and setup groups/permissions, if your not using LuckPerms you will need to edit the config a little!
